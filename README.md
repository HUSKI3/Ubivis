## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This project was created to simplify the use of Rust and VLang libraries internally at TecTone23, but can also be used for your own projects.

It's currently able to:
- Vlang
-- Build your source
-- Compile it into a shared object
-- Import the library into your project
- Rust
-- Import the library into your project

## Built With

- Python!

## Getting Started

You can install and set up ubivis by using poetry

### Installation

1. Create a new project
1.1 Manually
```sh
poetry init
poetry add ubivis
touch main.py
mkdir built
```
1.2 Using Ubivis
```sh
ubivis new # Experimental
```
2. Make a source file in another language
```sh
echo "\
[export: 'add']\
fn add(ctext &char) &char {\
mut s := unsafe { cstring_to_vstring(ctext) }\
return s.str\
}" >> src/v/example.v
```

3. Include it in your Python project
```python
from ubivis import ici, CFunc, Types
from ubivis.languages import Vlang

vlib = ici(Vlang("src/v/example.v", auto_construct=True)).new()
```

## Usage

Declaring the function
```python
@CFunc(
    (Types.CharPtr,),
    Types.CharPtr,
    test.lib.add
)
def add(msg: str):
    return vlib.add(msg.encode()).decode()

print(vadd("VLang!"))
```

Congratz! it's done!
